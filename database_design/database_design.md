# The Database design of the plugin

## Hotel Booking Lite related tables

All tables relating to Hotel booking Lite have the underscore “wp_mphp” and from testing all those tables are related to customers and not accommodations. This means an alternative solution will need to be discovered in order to use the accommodations generated by Hotel Booking Lite.

## WP Go maps related tables

All the tables relating to WP Go maps have the underscore “wp_wpgmza” and are all related to the maps. The table that we will be modifying is called “wp_wpgmza_maps” and this will allow us to generate multiple maps even though the free version only allows us to make one map. This will be useful in testing as we can have that be an expected cost in order to use the plugin.
