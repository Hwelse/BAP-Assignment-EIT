wk1: I started looking at the CRUD functionality for WordPress plugin. As I was making the plugin, the issue I ran into was that the table was not being made in the database. 
This prevented me from testing the rest of the CRUD functionality but I was able to get the menu to work. 
I am not able to figure out why the issue is occurring as the SQL code works in PHPadmin so I will try to isolate the code and work on it next week.

wk2: I first started testing the CRUD commands by making the table in PHPadmin and using the plugin to modify the records inside the table. 
Once I got the commands, I started working on getting the table to appear. I attempted copying the table from the example code but it did not work and I wrote the code manually and it also did not work.
 The only way I was able to have the table appear is to make a new plugin and re-write the code in there until it worked. 
 This must have been because of a conflict that prevented the table from being created but now that it has I can start making the table to be more precise for the business context
 
wk3: After our class, I remembered John talking about how we can use plugins to compensate for functionality that our plugin could not meet. I looked online for plugins that could be used to meet the business requirements of the assignment
 and I came across hotel booking lite which has all the functionality I would need in order to make a property-letting site. I currently could not decide between WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) and WP Maps as the first option is better if you use the premium version
 and WP Maps is free but it requires more work to be equal to WP GO Maps.
 
 wk4: As the presentation was getting closer, I decided to prioritize what the end product of the plugin would look like. I did this by making accommodations and maps in wordpress and using Elementor to place these parts on a page. Once I have finished getting the visuals for the website, 
 I worked on designing the queries that the plugin should be able to produce. The tables that I made focused on linking the two tables together but as I looked into the viability of making these queries, I found out that I would need to find a plugin to track the number of visits to an accommodation and to make a custom post type in order to link the two plugins together.
Next week I will start adding in the new functionality.
 
 wk5:After the presentation I looked into the plugins I brought up last week. Unfortunately, I was not able to find a plugin that allowed me to find out when how often an accommodation was clicked as it appeared to be only for posts. The WP Maps did not appear to be a viable option as it did not add any new tables to the WordPress tables
 so that means I cannot use it for the plugin as it does not allow me to us the CRUD functionality I learned at the start of this course. This means for the rest of this project I will have to use WP Go Maps as it does make tables for me to use CRUD with.
 
 wk6: The hotel booking lite plugin had a major flaw as the tables that it did make were not ones that stored the accommodation type or the amenities. So unless I find documentation that allows me to get access to this information, I cannot use custom posts to link the accommodation with WP Go Maps. If I can get it to work I can make the plugin generate a custom post which will generate the information from hotel booking and the Google map linked to it using their respective plugins.
